      <p>
        Since joining Marketo in November 2017, I've worked on several projects, learned a lot of technical and soft skills, and made great friendships.
        This was my first full-time software engineering job so I was definitely eager and ready to learn everything I could.

      <h4>Livefeed</h4>
        <span>
          Mainly worked on the the frontend. Created a tab where users could create tasks (email, call, inmail) and take actions on it.
          Collaborated with UX designer to help with designing the look and feel.

      <h4>Outlook Email Reply Tracking</h4>
        <span>Worked with Microsoft's Outlook REST and SOAP APIs to monitor a user's inbox and figure out </span>
      <h4>Marketo Unsubscribes Check</h4>
        <span>
          Had to use Marketo's APIs to check against their database. This would check to see if a particular email was unsubscribed or not
          from emails. If so, we would have to render the correct error messaging on the frontend. We'd have this check everywhere in an app where
          an email was being created.
