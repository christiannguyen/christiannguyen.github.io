    <h3>Work in Progress</h3>
    <p>
      Currently not hosted anywhere yet. Main idea was just to learn and play
      around with React Hooks and some other frontend things I've never really
      touched such as styled-components. Worked with Indeed's API to grab a list
      of postings. Express backend handles making the request to Indeed's API
      and parsed/organized in the backend. The data is then passed frontend to
      be displayed.
